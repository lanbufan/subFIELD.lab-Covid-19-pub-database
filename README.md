# Link-Cov-P Dataset

What Covid-19 bibliometric data are you using for this project?

Our goal is to provide (1) an up-to-date and (2) comprehensive bibliometric database on covid-19 publications with daily updates (22 299 cases as of today). We consolidate and link Covid-19 related publications from more than three authoritative sources.  In other words, our Record Linkage database is building on a number of ongoing and important projects; LitCovid and CORD-19, and World Health Organization's Global research on coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

## Getting Started

For researchers or data scientists looking to explore the dataset, you only need to donwload:

* the latest version of the [Link-Cov-P dataset](Link-Cov-P_2020_05_28_public_clean.zip)

For those interested in the "back-end" of things, or in helping the development of this project, please get in touch with me:

* The current dev priorities for me goes to the full development of the [Daily Scientific Citation Tracker](https://github.com/lanbufan/Daily-Scientific-Citation-Tracker).
* That said, in the spirit of open-source, I will start with providing a detailled methodology write-up and then, when time permit, I want to do a reformatting of the Python code taking care of the daily Record Linkage.

### Prerequisites

* currently, just a CSV download, no source code
